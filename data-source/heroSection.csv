description,"Humans have evolved from the latent memories ancestral past which explains similar modes of functioning patterns of behaviour that occurs across the globe. This understanding of human personality always fascinates me. As a student of Art College I was drawn into painting masks, Fathoming various complexities of human mind in diverse and challenging situations.
